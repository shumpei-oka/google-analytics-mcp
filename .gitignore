# Service Account Key - IMPORTANT!
# Do not commit your service account key file.
# The server is configured to read the key from the path
# provided via the extension settings UI, not from the project directory.
# However, as a safeguard, we recommend adding your key file name here
# if you place it within the project folder during testing.
# Example:
# my-secret-key.json
*.json
!package.json
!package-lock.json
!manifest.json
